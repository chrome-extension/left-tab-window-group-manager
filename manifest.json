  "description": "Reset the selected tab for each window to its left most tab (first). Why? Because window lists (Window menu) lists the currently selected tab and there are many times when that tab-title will not help you find what the original intention of that new window was intended to be. Technique: Group your windows into small numbers of tabs with the left most tab being the indentifier for the group. Use this extension's browser action to reset the select tabs on all your windows so that you can find the group of tabs your are looking for.",
